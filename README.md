# Memory Card Game

A memory card game built in the Springboard Software Engineering program.

To resolve the bug of users clicking on more than two cards at a time prior to the setTimeout() function ending, the lockBoard feature was implemented as outlined in the first of five answers in this [Stack Overflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52824248/how-to-stop-other-code-from-running-until-settimeout-finishes-running/52824344).
